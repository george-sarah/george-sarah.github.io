Iâ€™m Sarah George, a postdoctoral researcher at the Leibniz Institute for Educational Trajectories (LIfBi) and the [WZB Berlin Social Science Center](https://www.wzb.eu/de/personen/sarah-george). My research focuses on urban inequalities, including segregation and gentrification, with a particular emphasis on ethnic inequalities. 

As part of the [UneTra](https://unetra.wzb.eu/) project, I examine how the spatial distribution of refugees within local neighborhoods in Germany affects their educational trajectories and integration.
