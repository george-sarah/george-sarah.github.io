Iâ€™m Sarah George, a postdoctoral researcher at the Leibniz Institute for Educational Trajectories (LIfBi) and the [WZB Berlin Social Science Center](https://www.wzb.eu/de/personen/sarah-george). My research focuses on urban inequalities, including segregation and gentrification, with a particular emphasis on ethnic inequalities. 

As part of the [UneTra](https://unetra.wzb.eu/) project, I examine how the spatial distribution of refugees within local neighborhoods in Germany affects their educational trajectories and integration.

Previously, I completed my PhD at the Berlin Social Science Center and the University of Hamburg. During my doctoral studies, I also had the opportunity to be a visiting researcher at Harvard University. 

My research interests focus on urban inequalities, migration, and social stratification, with particular attention to segregation, gentrification, and educational disparities. I investigate how spatial dynamics shape the multidimensional integration of refugees, and how socio-spatial factors influence mobility, access to resources, and social exclusion in urban contexts. Applying quantitative and mixed-method approaches, my work contributes to understanding the complex interplay between structural inequalities and individual experiences in cities.

My research has been published in journals such as [Journal of Ethnic and Migration Studies](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1369183X.2025.2492346) and [Cities](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264275124007212), among others. I am actively engaged in public debates on urban transformations, providing insights for broader audiences. I have contributed analysis to outlets including [Deutschlandfunk](https://www.deutschlandfunk.de/verkehrsberuhigung-wie-geschaeftsleute-und-anwohner-mitnehmen-100.html), Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ) or [Die ZEIT](https://www.zeit.de/mobilitaet/2025-07/mobilitaet-migranten-auto-bus-vermoegen).
